# Machine Learning

This exam consisted of a written test and a project on the main topics of the course.

This project was carried out together with my colleagues **Diego Bartoli Geijo** and **Lorenzo Bruni** and consists of a **Knime workflow** for the application of multiple Machine Learning techniques to two **classification** tasks, identified with the analysis of the following dataset downloaded from **Kaggle**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption. In particular, we conducted a predictive analysis based on the correlations between alcohol, social conditions and student performances.

Final grade: **30**.
