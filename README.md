# Analysis of Scholastic Performances on Student Alcohol Consumption Dataset

This project was carried out together with my colleagues **Diego Bartoli Geijo** and **Lorenzo Bruni** and consists of a **Knime workflow** for the application of multiple Machine Learning techniques to two **classification** tasks, identified with the analysis of the following dataset downloaded from **Kaggle**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption. 

We conducted a predictive analysis based on the correlations between alcohol, social conditions and student performances,applying various algorithms (e.g. Random Forest, MLP, Decision Trees) and ML techniques (e.g. cross-validation), and then compared the various performances in terms of **effectiveness** and **efficiency**.
